# Quiz 5 - Text Generation with LSTM

We used Tensorflow to generate texts of Shakespeare's dialogue, with LSTM and per-character training.

## Instructions

Simply open up quiz.ipynb and run the code blocks one-by-one

You only need to generate the model once, as it gets stored to the training_checkpoints folder.

A pre-generated weights file with epoch=3 and epoch=10 is provided for convenience.

## Samples generated with Epoch=10
